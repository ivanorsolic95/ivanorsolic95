Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ivan Orsolic, a web developer from Osijek, Croatia, with a unique background in food engineering. Transitioning from overseeing large-scale production in the food industry to coding, I bring a meticulous and innovative approach to modern web technologies. 

Check out some of my most recent projects:

- [Meteo Web](https://meteoweb.netlify.app/): A python-based tutorial on how to make your own weather station.
- [MyReads](https://myreads2.netlify.app/): A book tracking app that allows users to organize their books into three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read.
- [MyStore](https://mystoreproject.netlify.app/): An e-commerce application built with Angular that simulates an online shopping experience.

You can find info about me, like my CV, projects, LinkedIn at [this link](https://ivanorsolic.netlify.app/), if you're interested in that!
